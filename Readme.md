# Simple NLP Application

## Simple TF-IDF and K-Means Clustering
- This is a program to cluster the text on the basis of the word data.
- Text Preprocessing is done using basic python code
- Feature Extraction is done using TF-IDF algorithm
- And Clustering is done my K means clustering

## Simple Word2Vec and K-Means Clustering
- This is the code to cluster text similar to other one
- Here we used word2vec inplace of TF-IDF to extract the feature in vector
- Considering the limitation of TF-IDF(or BoW), word2vec seems better option
- And clustering is done same as above using KMeans
